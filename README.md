# Predicting-Flight-Cancellations-Using-Machine-Learning

Flight cancellations pose significant operational and financial challenges for airlines, leading to inefficiencies, customer dissatisfaction, and increased costs. This project aimed to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to identify potential cancellations proactively. By analyzing historical data and applying advanced analytical methods, the project provided actionable insights to optimize resource allocation and enhance operational efficiency.
